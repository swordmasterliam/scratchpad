## Personalize The Application

To personalize the application, create **spstyle.css** in your user folder (*ex: C:\Users\Paul\spstyle.css*). Edit the file to include any CSS styling you want, save your changes, then restart the program. If done correctly, it should load your custom styling.

> [!NOTE]
> The UI is built with Qt5 (*PyQt5, to be specific*). You can read the documentation for Qt5 CSS styling [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html).
